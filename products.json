[{"id":1,"name":"Operating Systems - Three Easy Pieces","content":"OSTEP (\"oh step\"), or the \"the comet book,\" represents the culmination of years of teaching intro to operating systems to both undergraduates and graduates at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Computer Sciences department for nearly 20 years. The book is organized around three concepts fundamental to OS construction: virtualization (of CPU and memory), concurrency (locks and condition variables), and persistence (disks, RAIDS, and file systems). The material, if combined with serious project work and homeworks, will lead students to a deeper understanding and appreciation of modern OSes. The authors, Remzi and Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau, are both professors of Computer Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. They have been doing research in computer systems for over 20 years, working together since their first graduate operating systems class at U.C. Berkeley in 1993. Since that time, they have published over 100 papers on the performance and reliability of many aspects of modern computer systems, with a special focus on file and storage systems. Their work has been recognized with numerous best-paper awards, and some of their innovations can be found in the Linux and BSD operating systems today.","meta_description":"Textbook on Operating Systems","meta_title":"Operating Systems - Three Easy Pieces","price":24.61,"slug":"operating-systems-three-easy-pieces","published_at":"2021-01-27T17:47:49.351Z","created_at":"2021-01-27T17:47:34.802Z","updated_at":"2021-01-27T17:47:49.382Z","image":{"id":1,"name":"download.jpeg","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":108,"height":162,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_download.jpeg","hash":"thumbnail_download_b90098f7ed","ext":".jpeg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":104,"height":156,"size":4.92,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_download_b90098f7ed.jpeg"}},"hash":"download_b90098f7ed","ext":".jpeg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":4.73,"url":"/uploads/download_b90098f7ed.jpeg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2021-01-27T17:45:49.647Z","updated_at":"2021-01-27T17:45:49.660Z"}},{"id":2,"name":"Computer Organization and Design MIPS Edition","content":"Computer Organization and Design, Fifth Edition, is the latest update to the classic introduction to computer organization. The text now contains new examples and material highlighting the emergence of mobile computing and the cloud. It explores this generational change with updated content featuring tablet computers, cloud infrastructure, and the ARM (mobile computing devices) and x86 (cloud computing) architectures. The book uses a MIPS processor core to present the fundamentals of hardware technologies, assembly language, computer arithmetic, pipelining, memory hierarchies and I/O.Because an understanding of modern hardware is essential to achieving good performance and energy efficiency, this edition adds a new concrete example, Going Faster, used throughout the text to demonstrate extremely effective optimization techniques. There is also a new discussion of the Eight Great Ideas of computer architecture. Parallelism is examined in depth with examples and content highlighting parallel hardware and software topics. The book features the Intel Core i7, ARM Cortex-A8 and NVIDIA Fermi GPU as real-world examples, along with a full set of updated and improved exercises.\n\nThis new edition is an ideal resource for professional digital system designers, programmers, application developers, and system software developers. It will also be of interest to undergraduate students in Computer Science, Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering courses in Computer Organization, Computer Design, ranging from Sophomore required courses to Senior Electives.\n\nWinner of a 2014 Texty Award from the Text and Academic Authors AssociationIncludes new examples, exercises, and material highlighting the emergence of mobile computing and the cloudCovers parallelism in depth with examples and content highlighting parallel hardware and software topics Features the Intel Core i7, ARM Cortex-A8 and NVIDIA Fermi GPU as real-world examples throughout the book Adds a new concrete example, \"Going Faster,\" to demonstrate how understanding hardware can inspire software optimizations that improve performance by 200 timesDiscusses and highlights the \"Eight Great Ideas\" of computer architecture: Performance via Parallelism; Performance via Pipelining; Performance via Prediction; Design for Moore's Law; Hierarchy of Memories; Abstraction to Simplify Design; Make the Common Case Fast; and Dependability via RedundancyIncludes a full set of updated and improved exercises\nSource: Publisher","meta_description":"Computer Organization and Design, Fifth Edition, is the latest update to the classic introduction to computer organization","meta_title":"Computer Organization and Design MIPS Edition","price":62.9,"slug":"computer-organization-and-design-mips-edition","published_at":"2021-01-27T17:49:57.196Z","created_at":"2021-01-27T17:49:54.979Z","updated_at":"2021-01-27T17:49:57.215Z","image":{"id":2,"name":"download (1).jpeg","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":126,"height":149,"formats":null,"hash":"download_1_3f6976e95c","ext":".jpeg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":5.96,"url":"/uploads/download_1_3f6976e95c.jpeg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2021-01-27T17:48:53.468Z","updated_at":"2021-01-27T17:48:53.481Z"}}]
